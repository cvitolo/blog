# Welcome to my website!

Ciao! 

I'm Claudia, a Scientist working on natural hazard risk modelling at [ECMWF](http://www.ecmwf.int/). In this website you can find out about my background and experience (in the [About me](/about/) section), what I work on (in the [Projects](/project/) section), what I'm curious about (in the [Blog](/post/) section) and what I like to talk about (in the [Talks](/post/) section). 

Buona lettura!
