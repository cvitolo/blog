Ciao!

My name is Claudia Vitolo, I'm Italian and I work as Scientist at the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts ([ECMWF](http://www.ecmwf.int/), Reading, United Kingdom) on natural hazard risk modelling. My work consists of developing tools and algorithms to facilitate the retrieval, modelling and visualisation of environmental data.

I'm passionate about open knowledge/data/source projects and addicted to [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (the statistical language). In my spare time I like to participate to hackatons, coding do-jos. I organise meetups in the data science field as well as kaggle competitions. I'm a member of the [R-Ladies](http://rladies.org/) leadership team, a world-wide organization to promote gender diversity in the R community.

Here is my [curriculum vitae](claudias-curriculum-vitae.pdf).

I have an old blog on [wordpress](https://aquaresearcher.wordpress.com/).
