On 18th November 2015 I gave a talk on "Improving access to geospatial Big Data in the hydrology domain" for the "Big Data and Spatial Analytics" event organised by the Business and Industrial Section of the **Royal Statistical Society** (London, United Kingdom). It was a great opportunity to meet people interested in Big Data and geospatial analytics.

I presented some of the work done for my PhD and the PURE project. Slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10KiLP23baYXNmgMOf9DQW-kWffgfIv83OZr6aZkcwuE/edit?usp=sharing). I also presented a demo (the code is available [here](https://gist.github.com/cvitolo/5f476832243a37923615)).
