On 26th April 2017 I ran a workshop on "Making your own blog" for one of the community events organised by **R-Ladies London** (London, United Kingdom). All the attendees were very interested and participative, it was a great evening!

Slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tTGoYo3rgkmo-OEU-yYwNOUHnG2mw9mUPnATAA4CaU8/edit?usp=sharing).
