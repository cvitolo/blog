On 12th February 2016 I was invited to give a talk on "Why and how open data and open APIs can improve research" for the Environmental Dynamics research group seminar series is organised at the Department of Geography of **King's College London** (London, United Kingdom). The audience was made of students, researchers and academics, all interested and participative, which made the experience rather enjoyable for me. More information on this series of seminars is on the [King's geocomputation](http://kingsgeocomputation.org/2016/01/28/forthcoming-seminars-sdgs-apis-cities/) blog.

I presented work done for my PhD and the PURE project. During my seminar I showed how to assemble data requests using the National River Flow Archive's RESTful APIs, how to parse and convert server responses using the R language and the rnrfa package. Slides are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1utJMhrZQNY0GjprDd8hGcBoTUlmOSgUJOgTOV5EVj5k/edit?usp=sharing). I also presented a demo (code and examples are taken from this [paper](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/accepted/vitolo-fry-buytaert.pdf)).
