In my spare time I like to participate to hackatons, coding do-jos and I organise meetups in the data science field. 
Here is a list of community events I have contributed to:

- [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/) (co-founder), a world-wide organization to promote gender diversity in the R community.
- [R-Ladies London](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-london/) (co-organiser), the London chapter is very active with regular (~monthly) meetups are socials. More info on the R-Ladies London meetup page.
- [Open Data Hack @ECMWF](http://www.ecmwf.int/en/learning/workshops/opendatahack-ecmwf-beyond-weather-explore-creative-uses-open-data) (co-organiser), the event was part of ECMWF's Open Data Week and aimed to raise awareness of freely available data from ECMWF and the three Copernicus services Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) and Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS).
- [Data Science in Reading](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Reading/) (co-organised the event related to the 'Women in Data Science conference 2017').
