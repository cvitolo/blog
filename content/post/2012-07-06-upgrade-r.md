I'm using Ubuntu Oneiric and R 2.13 (check your version using the command: `lsb_release -a`).

Now I need to upgrade R to the latest version to be able to install the package lhs.

In the file:

```
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```

I added the line:

```
deb http://cran.ma.imperial.ac.uk/bin/linux/ubuntu oneiric/
```

([here](http://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) the complete list of cran mirrors)

and saved it.

Then in terminal:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install r-base
sudo apt-get install r-base-dev
```

The first time you install a package in R 2.15, it asks: "Would you like to use a personal library?", type `y` and then just copy all the packages from ~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/2.13 to ~/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/2.15.
