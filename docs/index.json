	"content": "Few years ago I started blogging, mainly to collect notes and interesting experiments for my PhD. I used wordpress and I found it very convenient at that time. Nowdays, using R for just about everything, I could not resist to the temptation of making my own blog using blogdown and HUGO. However I did not want to maintain two blogs so I had to: export my wordpress content convert this content to markdown set up a hugo blog Export wordpress content I started googling &amp;lsquo;how to migrate from wordpress to markdown&amp;rsquo;. I found out that it is possible to export the entire wordpress blog (in xml format) using the exporter tool in the wordpress admin dashboard. Just log in to your wordpress -&amp;gt; My Sites -&amp;gt; Settings -&amp;gt; Export -&amp;gt; click on the button &amp;lsquo;Export all&amp;rsquo;. Let&amp;rsquo;s call the downloaded file wp.xml Convert wordpress content to markdown Amongst the various options I decided to use for exitwp, it is a simple and very efficient solution to convert the xml file to a series of markdown files. I cloned the githup repository locally, pasted the wp.xml file in the exitwp/wordpress-xml directory, and run Set up a hugo blog I have built this website using blogdowm and the docdock theme for HUGO.

	"description": "",
	"content": "I have been recently working on a rather basic task: splitting long time series into years. Although this might sound trivial for calendar years, I had to think a bit to find a relatively elegant solution for hydrological years. Below is what I came up with, however if you are aware of a better way, please leave a comment! For this exercise, we need to load only one library: # Load library library(xts) Let&amp;rsquo;s generate a dummy time series: # Generate dummy time series from &amp;lt;- as.Date(&amp;quot;1950-01-01&amp;quot;) to &amp;lt;- as.Date(&amp;quot;1990-12-31&amp;quot;) myDates &amp;lt;- seq.Date(from=from,to=to,by=&amp;quot;day&amp;quot;) myTS &amp;lt;- as.xts(runif(length(myDates)),order.by=myDates) When working with standard calendar years (from Jan to Dec), splitting a time series into years is not too much of a problem: # Split the time series into calendar years myList &amp;lt;- tapply(myTS, format(myDates, &amp;quot;%Y&amp;quot;), c) The result is a list of 41 time series, each of lenght = 1 year. Any time series can be accessed, as usual, via its index: myList[[1]] plot( myList[[1]] ) Things become more interesting with non-standard calendars, such as hydrological years (starting on the 1st October and ending on the following 30th September). The first step is to calculate the number of hydrological years, this is going to be: the number of years in which we have records from Jan (index = 0) to September (index = 8) minus 1 (because we cannot count the first year). # calculate the number of hydrological years nHY &amp;lt;- length(split(myTS[.indexmon(myTS) %in% 0:8], f=&amp;quot;years&amp;quot;))-1 Then we create an empty list and populate it with a series in which we append (or bind) the records from October to December of a generic year counter&#39;&#39;, to the records from Jan to Sep of the yearcounter+1&amp;rdquo;. # create an empty table , to be populate by a loop myList &amp;lt;- list() for ( counter in 1:nHY ){ oct2dec &amp;lt;- split(myTS[.indexmon(myTS) %in% 9:11], f=&amp;quot;years&amp;quot;)[[counter]] jan2sep &amp;lt;- split(myTS[.indexmon(myTS) %in% 0:8], f=&amp;quot;years&amp;quot;)[[counter + 1]] myList[[counter]] &amp;lt;- rbind(oct2dec, jan2sep) } Again, any time series can be accessed via its index: myList[[1]] plot( myList[[1]] ) That&amp;rsquo;s all!

	"content": "The R package hddtools is an open source project designed to facilitate non programmatic access to on-line data sources. This typically implies the download of a metadata catalogue, selection of information needed, formal request for dataset(s), de-compression, conversion, manual filtering and parsing. All those operation are made more efficient by re-usable functions. Depending on the data license, functions can provide offline and/or on-line modes. When redistribution is allowed, for instance, a copy of the dataset is cached within the package and updated twice a year. This is the fastest option and also allows offline use of package&amp;rsquo;s functions. When re-distribution is not allowed, only on-line mode is provided. The package hddtools can be installed via devtools: library(devtools) install_github(&amp;quot;r_hddtools&amp;quot;, username = &amp;quot;cvitolo&amp;quot;, subdir = &amp;quot;hddtools&amp;quot;) library(hddtools) Data sources and Functions The Koppen Climate Classification map The Koppen Climate Classification is the most widely used system for classifying the world&amp;rsquo;s climates. Its categories are based on the annual and monthly averages of temperature and precipitation. It was first updated by Rudolf Geiger in 1961, then by Kottek et al. (2006), Peel et al. (2007) and then by Rubel et al. (2010). The package hddtools contains a function to identify the updated Koppen-Greiger climate zone, given a bounding box.

The database was prepared from source databases for research purposes, with the intention to make it re-usable. This is now available in the public domain free of charge.

The TRMM satellite records global historical rainfall estimation in a gridded format since 1998 with a daily temporal resolution and a spatial resolution of 0.25 degrees. This information is openly available for educational purposes and downloadable from an FTP server.

If you want to know what FUSE is, how to prepare your data and run a simple simulation go to the first post of the series, for a basic calibration example (using 1 model structure) go to the second post, while for an example of multi-model calibration got to the third post. RHydro-HydroMAD compatibility HydroMAD is an excellent framework for hydrological modelling, optimization, sensitivity analysis and assessment of results. It contains a large set of soil moisture accounting modules and routing functions. Thanks to Joseph Guillaume (hydromad&amp;rsquo;s maintainer), FUSE-RHydro is now compatible with HydroMAD, therefore using and calibrating FUSE becomes even easier! Joseph provided many of the examples below, many thanks for that too! In this tutorial I will show how to: set up FUSE and its parameter ranges using the hydromad approach run a simulation calibrate FUSE using one of the hydromad&amp;rsquo;s algorithms Recap from previous posts Load the package and prepare your default list of models library(&amp;quot;hydromad&amp;quot;) library(&amp;quot;RHydro&amp;quot;) data(modlist) Read sample data in: data &amp;lt;- read.csv(&amp;quot;dummyData.csv&amp;quot;) Convert to date the first column and then convert to zoo object temp&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[,&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;m&amp;quot;&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;]&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;o&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;-&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;kp&amp;quot;&amp;gt;as.Date&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;(&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;temp&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[,&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;m&amp;quot;&amp;gt;1&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;],&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;format&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;o&amp;quot;&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;s&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;quot;%Y-%m-%d&amp;quot;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;) &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;DATA &amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;o&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;-&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; read.zoo&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;(&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;temp&amp;lt;span class=&amp;quot;p&amp;quot;&amp;gt;)&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt; Step 1: set up FUSE and its parameter ranges using the hydromad approach HydroMAD allows to specify a rainfall-runoff model of choice.

As an example, the Shuffled Complex Evolution method can be used as shown below.

This tutorials was just a brief introduction to a topic that can be explored in many different directions. From a technical point of view, it could be worth to invest some effort into code optimization and/or parallelisation. This would also have an impact on the scientific side facilitating experiments on sensitivity analysis, regionalisation of catchment characteristics and model structure variability. Some of those ideas are already on their way, some others are just random thoughts. Therefore&amp;hellip;watch this space! "

The real advantage of using FUSE is the possibility to work with an ensemble of multiple models so that uncertainties related to the model structure can be quantified. The input that defines the model structure is called mid (model identification number) and its value ranges between 1 and 1248. When the most suitable model structure(s) is not known a priori, the mid can be added to the list of parameters and calibrated. Adding the full mid-range implies the need to increase significantly the sampling space. There are, however, 4 model structures (called parent models) from which all the other model combinations are derived. In this tutorial I will only consider those 4 model structures. In this tutorial I will show how to: define the update sampling space (parameter + mid ranges) run a multi-model calibration compare results Step A: define the parameter ranges + mid range The parent models are as follows: 60 = TOPMODEL 230 = ARNOXVIC 342 = PRMS 426 = SACRAMENTO Therefore mid can be one of those 4 values: mids &amp;lt;- c(60, 230, 342, 426) The parameter ranges are defined as in the previous post. require(tgp) DefaultRanges &amp;lt;- data.frame(rbind(rferr_add = c(0,0), rferr_mlt = c(1,1), maxwatr_1 = c(25,500), maxwatr_2 = c(50,5000), fracten = c(0.05,0.95), frchzne = c(0.05,0.95), fprimqb = c(0.05,0.95), rtfrac1 = c(0.05,0.95), percrte = c(0.01,1000), percexp = c(1,20), sacpmlt = c(1,250), sacpexp = c(1,5), percfrac = c(0.05,0.95), iflwrte = c(0.01,1000), baserte = c(0.001,1000), qb_powr = c(1,10), qb_prms = c(0.001,0.25), qbrate_2a = c(0.001,0.25), qbrate_2b = c(0.001,0.25), sareamax = c(0.05,0.95), axv_bexp = c(0.001,3), loglamb = c(5,10), tishape = c(2,5), timedelay = c(0.01,5))) names(DefaultRanges) &amp;lt;- c(&amp;quot;Min&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;Max&amp;quot;) nRuns &amp;lt;- 100 parameters &amp;lt;- lhs( nRuns, as.matrix(DefaultRanges) ) parameters &amp;lt;- data.frame(parameters) names(parameters) &amp;lt;- c(&amp;quot;rferr_add&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;rferr_mlt&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;maxwatr_1&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;maxwatr_2&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;fracten&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;frchzne&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;fprimqb&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;rtfrac1&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;percrte&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;percexp&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sacpmlt&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sacpexp&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;percfrac&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;iflwrte&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;baserte&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;qb_powr&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;qb_prms&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;qbrate_2a&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;qbrate_2b&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;sareamax&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;axv_bexp&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;loglamb&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;tishape&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;timedelay&amp;quot;) Step B: run a multi-model calibration Use the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency as objective function and run the model 4*nRuns times (for each mid and parameter set). require(qualV) indices &amp;lt;- rep(NA,4*nRuns) discharges &amp;lt;- matrix(NA,ncol=4*nRuns,nrow=dim(DATA)[1]) kCounter &amp;lt;- 0 for (m in 1:4){ myMID &amp;lt;- mids[m] for (pid in 1:nRuns){ kCounter &amp;lt;- kCounter + 1 ParameterSet &amp;lt;- as.list(parameters[pid,]) # Run FUSE Soil Moisture Accounting module Qinst &amp;lt;- fusesma.sim(DATA, mid = myMID, modlist, deltim = myDELTIM, states = FALSE, fluxes = FALSE, fracstate0 = 0.25, ParameterSet$rferr_add, ParameterSet$rferr_mlt, ParameterSet$frchzne, ParameterSet$fracten, ParameterSet$maxwatr_1, ParameterSet$percfrac, ParameterSet$fprimqb, ParameterSet$qbrate_2a, ParameterSet$qbrate_2b, ParameterSet$qb_prms, ParameterSet$maxwatr_2, ParameterSet$baserte, ParameterSet$rtfrac1, ParameterSet$percrte, ParameterSet$percexp, ParameterSet$sacpmlt, ParameterSet$sacpexp, ParameterSet$iflwrte, ParameterSet$axv_bexp, ParameterSet$sareamax, ParameterSet$loglamb, ParameterSet$tishape, ParameterSet$qb_powr) # Run FUSE Routing module Qrout &amp;lt;- fuserouting.sim(Qinst, mid = myMID, modlist = modlist, timedelay = ParameterSet$timedelay, deltim = myDELTIM) indices[kCounter] &amp;lt;- EF(DATA$Q,Qrout) discharges[,kCounter] &amp;lt;- Qrout } } Step C: compare results Deterministically, the best simulation according to the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, is the one with the maximum factor. bestRun &amp;lt;- which(indices == max(indices)) This corresponds to the model ARNOXVIC, in fact: bestModel &amp;lt;- function(runNumber){ if (runNumber&amp;lt;(nRuns+1)) myBestModel &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;TOPMODEL&amp;quot; if (runNumber&amp;gt;(nRuns+1) &amp;amp; runNumber&amp;lt;(2*nRuns+1)) myBestModel &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;ARNOXVIC&amp;quot; if (runNumber&amp;gt;(2*nRuns+1) &amp;amp; runNumber&amp;lt;(3*nRuns+1)) myBestModel &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;PRMS&amp;quot; if (runNumber&amp;gt;(3*nRuns+1) &amp;amp; runNumber&amp;lt;(4*nRuns+1)) myBestModel &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;SACRAMENTO&amp;quot; return(myBestModel) } bestModel(bestRun) plot(coredata(DATA$Q),type=&amp;quot;l&amp;quot;,xlab=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;,ylab=&amp;quot;Streamflow [mm/day]&amp;quot;, lwd=0.5) for(pid in 1:(4*nRuns)){ lines(discharges[,pid], col=&amp;quot;gray&amp;quot;, lwd=3) } lines(coredata(DATA$Q),col=&amp;quot;black&amp;quot;, lwd=1) lines(discharges[,bestRun],col=&amp;quot;red&amp;quot;, lwd=1) The plot below shows the observed streamflow in black, all the simulated results in grey and the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; simulated streamflow in red.

	"content": "This is the first of a series of tutorials on the FUSE implementation within the RHydro package. The script for this tutorial is available here. If you are interested in following the discussion related to this post and see how it evolves, join the R4Hydrology community on Google+! What&amp;rsquo;s FUSE? FUSE is an ensemble of numerous conceptual rainfall-runoff models developed byClark et al. (2008) and used to simulate the streamflow discharge for a river catchment when areal averaged time series of precipitation (plus snowmelt) and evapotranspiration are available. The code was originally developed by Martyn Clark in Fortran, but a couple of years ago I implemented a version of the same code in R. The code is part of the RHydro package available from R-Forge. In this tutorial I&amp;rsquo;m going to show how to: install RHydro, prepare data for FUSE, run a simulation. Step A: install RHydro RHydro is available from R-Forge and can beinstalled running the following command: install.packages(&amp;quot;RHydro&amp;quot;, repos = &amp;quot;http://R-Forge.R-project.org&amp;quot;) Step B: prepare your data Prepare your data so that you have a zooreg object containing valid dates, P (precipitation+snowmelt time series), E (potential evapotranspiration time series) and Q (streamflow discharge time series). If you do not know how to do this, download my dummy data from here and adapt the content. [caption id=&amp;ldquo;attachment_301&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;aligncenter&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;223&amp;rdquo;] Screenshot of dummyData.csv[/caption] Save dummyData.csv in your working directory. Now, load important libraries and create the zooreg object. # Load libraries library(RHydro) # Load data into a zooreg object temp &amp;lt;- read.csv(&amp;quot;dummyData.csv&amp;quot;) DATA &amp;lt;- zooreg(temp[,2:4], order.by=temp[,1]) Step C: run a simulation FUSE contains 1248 different model structures. If you want to use only one of them, you should specify the relative model identification number (mid). Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that: you want to run the model that corresponds to mid = 60, you want to use a specific set of parameters, you data is made of daily time series. Then, you define the model inputs as in the example below: # (1) myMID &amp;lt;- 60 # (2) myParameterSet &amp;lt;- list(rferr_add = 0, rferr_mlt = 1, frchzne = 0.5, fracten = 0.6828, maxwatr_1 = 106.6406, percfrac = 0.5, fprimqb = 0.5, qbrate_2a = 0.025, qbrate_2b = 0.01, qb_prms = 0.1294, maxwatr_2 = 3839.8, baserte = 50, rtfrac1 = 0.75, percrte = 703.128, percexp = 4.8594, sacpmlt = 10, sacpexp = 5, iflwrte = 500, axv_bexp = 0.7039, sareamax = 0.25, loglamb = 7.5, tishape = 3, qb_powr = 5, timedelay = 1.3355) # (3) myDELTIM &amp;lt;- 1 You can calculate the effective rainfall as follows: Qinst &amp;lt;- fusesma.sim (DATA, mid = myMID, modlist, deltim = myDELTIM, states = FALSE, fluxes = FALSE, fracstate0 = 0.25, myParameterSet$rferr_add, myParameterSet$rferr_mlt, myParameterSet$frchzne, myParameterSet$fracten, myParameterSet$maxwatr_1, myParameterSet$percfrac, myParameterSet$fprimqb, myParameterSet$qbrate_2a, myParameterSet$qbrate_2b, myParameterSet$qb_prms, myParameterSet$maxwatr_2, myParameterSet$baserte, myParameterSet$rtfrac1, myParameterSet$percrte, myParameterSet$percexp, myParameterSet$sacpmlt, myParameterSet$sacpexp, myParameterSet$iflwrte, myParameterSet$axv_bexp, myParameterSet$sareamax, myParameterSet$loglamb, myParameterSet$tishape, myParameterSet$qb_powr) Now calculate the routed runoff: Qrout &amp;lt;- fuserouting.sim(Qinst, mid = myMID, modlist = modlist, timedelay = myParameterSet$timedelay, deltim = myDELTIM) Plot the routed discharge: plot(Qrout, type = &amp;quot;l&amp;quot;) If you are using my dummy data, the result of the last command should be as in the figure below. [caption id=&amp;ldquo;attachment_304&amp;rdquo; align=&amp;ldquo;alignnone&amp;rdquo; width=&amp;ldquo;300&amp;rdquo;] Routed streamflow discharge[/caption] The input fracstate0 (see fusesma function) refers to the initial conditions. The default value is 0.25 which means that at time = 0 the water storages already contain 25% of their maximum capacity. You can change this value to see how a variation of fracstate0 may affect the result of your simulation. What&amp;rsquo;s next? This tutorial assumes you want to use 1 model structure and 1 parameter set. which is a rather simplistic case. The majority of the time hydrologists might be interested in calibrating one specific model structure (see an example here). However, the real advantage of using FUSE is the possibility to work with an ensemble of multiple models (see an example here). FUSE-RHydro is also compatible with HydroMAD, therefore model calibration and assessment becomes even easier (see an example here)! "

	"content": "Imperial College London, as many other universities, provides an excellent High Performance Computing Service for its staff and students. It&amp;rsquo;s like a private cloud, with thousands of processors, which allows you to run highly demanding computational jobs. HPC service is particularly suitable for code which can be parallelised. There are many modules and libraries installed and you can use your own routines if written in a common programming/scripting language. For instance I used my R code. Here is a short tutorial on how to use HPC service. I first contacted the HPC Service Manager to activate an account with login credentials matching the college&amp;rsquo;s ones (e.g. my username is &amp;ldquo;user&amp;rdquo;). Once the account is active, the system automatically creates a key pair to easily remote access (for more info read my previous post here) and the following file stores become available: $HOME = /home/user (10GB and is intended for storing binaries, source and modest amounts of data) $WORK = /work/user (at least 150GB which is intended for staging files between jobs and for long term data storage) $TMPDIR = /tmp (to use only for temporary results) Refer to them using environmental variables. Next steps: to prepare the scripts I&amp;rsquo;ll use to run my computations (more info on Part 2). copy on the server the necessary input files, scripts and R packages, if not available online (see Part 3).
